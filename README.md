# Data on High School Dress-Code Rules
## by Shannon Washburn


I chose to investigate data that recorded high school dress code policies across the country. It had information such as the most common phrases used in the rules, the percentage of female to male clothes in violation, and the most common restrictions in place. I downloaded four CSV files from “the-pudding on Github”: sanctions.csv, school_metadata.csv, strap_restrictions.csv, length_restrictions.csv. 
A [link](https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/dress_codes) to my data. It was already pretty clean and I did not need to use any software to clean it.



I used four different CSV files. “Length-restrictions” and “Strap_restrictions” helped me figure out the most common phrases used to describe what restrictions are in place for length of shorts/skirts, and what are in place for the width of straps. “Sanctions.csv”identified which schools assigned which punishments, i.e. “Saturday school” or “detention”, and whether it was their 1st, 2nd, or 3rd offense, and on. School_metadata” describes which type of geographical region each school is located in, and the size. 



**Questions I want to ask:**

* *How many of the clothing items banned are from the “girls’ section” of the store, versus the boys’?*

I created a pie chart in Google Sheets to show that about 55% of clothing banned is made for girl’s, 40% made for both, and 4.3% made for boys.

m=male

* *What is the most common punishment?*

13 schools send the violator to Saturday school (after how many offenses varies, it is usually 2 or 3). 
The most common punishment, 346 schools require the student to “change clothes”. No more details are given. Other popular punishments include “parents called”, “detention”, and 10 schools even list “transfer expulsion”.



* *What is the most widely accepted strap length?*

Around 59% of schools describe straps in violation as “less than x inches”; 20% less than x fingers; and 10% “to the edge of shoulder”.

When breaking down the strap length restrictions by state, Utah had by far the most strap restrictions, with 13 labeled “less than x inches”, and 6 “less than x fingers”. I created a pie chart to show the most common shoulder strap rules:

* *What about shorts length?*

The most common phrasing is “shorter than fingertips” at about 28% of schools reviewed. Three other phrases were used by about 19% of schools each: “short/inappropriate length”, “shorter than x from knee”, and “shorter than mid-thigh”. I created a pie chart in Google Sheets to illustrate the most common shorts/skirts length rules:

*A challenge I ran into was trying to pinpoint geographical data; I wanted to see how strict each state was, but the criteria used phrases rather than actual counts of citations per student, which made it difficult to quantify.*


**Two data sets I think would be useful:**
1. The actual number of citations, or the ratios of violations between males and females, and how it compares by race. 
2. Have violations gone up in recent years, and have dress-codes become more or less strict throughout the past several decades?
